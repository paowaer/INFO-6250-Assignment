### Helping every kitty find a warm and loving home ❤️

## 🌟 **Where I Came From**

Hey there, hooman! 👋 I’m **Boogy**, a once-lonely kitty stuck in a shelter, dreaming of soft blankets and tasty treats.  
Then came my buddy, **Ian Ou**, who whisked me away to a magical land of fireplaces, comfy bed sheets, and unlimited head pats.

But as I snuggled into my new kingdom, I couldn’t stop thinking about my furry friends still waiting for their forever homes. 😿

So I built this app! Yup, paws on the keyboard, I created this full-stack(?) web application to help my friends out there find a human family as amazing as mine.
