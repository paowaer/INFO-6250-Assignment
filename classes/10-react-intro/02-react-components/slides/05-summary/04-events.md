# Summary - Event Handlers

Event handlers go on HTML tags in JSX
- Looks like HTML JS attributes
  - But aren't
- Must be `onEVENT` syntax
  - EVENT is a capitalized event name
  - So `onEVENT` will be camelCase
  - Ex: `onClick`, `onInput`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`
- Event handler props just names on components
  - But can be put on HTML elements
