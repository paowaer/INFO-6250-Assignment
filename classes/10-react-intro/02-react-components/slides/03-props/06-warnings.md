# Errors vs Warnings

- Technically, that was a **warning**
  - Doesn't stop the program from running
    - May not be _working_
- **Errors** stop a program from running
  - Try not closing a Component/element

Even though a warning doesn't stop the program
- **You should resolve warnings right away**
- It is literally a likely bug
  - Could impact what you're doing now
