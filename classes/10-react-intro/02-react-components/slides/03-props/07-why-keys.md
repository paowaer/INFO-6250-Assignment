# What is this warning saying?

- Wants `key` prop on each component in list
  - `key` must have a unique value
- React rewrites HTML when data changes
  - It wants to do so EFFICIENTLY
  - If you give me a list, then later give me list
  - Which added/removed vs changed?
- We need to identify the items of a list
  - And `list` is an array (list) of `<li>` elements
