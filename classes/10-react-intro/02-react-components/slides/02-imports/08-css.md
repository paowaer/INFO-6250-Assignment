# importing CSS

Vite allows you to import CSS files

```jsx
import './App.css';
```

- Makes the CSS available on the HTML page
  - No `<link>` or `<style>` required
- Filename can be anything
  - Must have `.css` extension
  - Must have a explicit path (e.g. `./`)
  - We follow convention from example code
    - Each Component has matching `.css` file
