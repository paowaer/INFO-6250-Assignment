# imports

- Most `import` syntax is what we already learned
- **default exports**
    - Used with Components, possilbly
- **named exports** 
    - Used with imports from 'react' library

Vite includes a **bundler** program 
- Rollup not Webpack
- Lets us use many files in dev
- Outputs to fewer files in prod
