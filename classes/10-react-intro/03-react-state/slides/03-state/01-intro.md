# Why State?

Remember the concept we are using
- State is variable(s) of values that can change
- **Rendering** is setting HTML based on state
- Events will change state
- After state changes, **render**

True both in React and in advanced plain JS SPAs

Every component defines part of HTML
- Based on state and props
