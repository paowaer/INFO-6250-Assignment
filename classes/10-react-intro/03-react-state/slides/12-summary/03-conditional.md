# Conditional Rendering

- Can't use `if ()` in `{}`
- React renders value from `{}`
    - Will not render `false`, `null`, `undefined`
- Logical ops in `{}` can conditionally render JSX
    - Watch out for `0` or `NaN`
    - Convert to boolean OR
    - Use conditional operator
- Conditional operator in `{}` conditionally renders
