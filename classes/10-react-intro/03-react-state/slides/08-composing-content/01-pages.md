# Conditional Rendering of "Pages"

- SPA is a "single page"
- We can change content
- Sometimes a little content
- Sometimes a lot of content
- Sometimes EVERYTHING

**Our app can show different "pages" based on state**
- Completely different "pages"
- Or just different parts
- "Screens", "views", "pages" 
    - No actual terminology
