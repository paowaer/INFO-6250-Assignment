# Where is the HTML?

The HTML is in `/index.html`
- BUT we won't be changing it
  - Except for anything in `<head>`
    - In particular, `<title>`
    - But also webfonts, more meta tags, etc
- Make all your changes in the js/jsx/css files in `src/`
  - `src/` for the files you edit!
  - These are NOT loaded by browser directly
    - Get **transpiled** into files for browser
