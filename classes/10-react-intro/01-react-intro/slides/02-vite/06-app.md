# Opening src/App.jsx

This looks like a mix of JS and HTML
- imports
  - Some we know, some we don't
- function App() returns HTML...ish (JSX)
  - Not as a string, just HTML-like
  - Has some values in `{}`
  - Uses `className` instead of `class`
  - There's an `onClick`

Now look at HTML for the page in DevTools
