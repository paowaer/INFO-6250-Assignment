# .jsx files

JSX files will work as either `.js` or `.jsx`
- For this course **you must use** `.jsx`
- Filename is extra information for coders
  - `.js` files should have NO JSX in them
  - `.jsx` files should be our view files
  - JSX is for UI, other logic is plain `.js`
    - Separates UI logic from **business logic**
    - Separates UI from sending/getting data
