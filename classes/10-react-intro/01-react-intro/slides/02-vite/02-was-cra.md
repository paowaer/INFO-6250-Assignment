# A Note about Create React App

Course previously used `create-react-app` (CRA)
- A lot of tutorials/docs on web will refer to CRA
    - Common starting point for React SPAs
- Over time
    - CRA got slower to install/use
    - Alternatives got more attention
    - Alternatives were good for more than SPAs

Course now uses `vite`
- Still SPA-focused
- NextJS, Remix are more involved alternatives
