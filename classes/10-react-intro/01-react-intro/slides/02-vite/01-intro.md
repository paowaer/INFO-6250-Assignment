# Vite 
React is great, but can have a lot of set up
- So we will have someone else do the hard work
- `vite` is a program to set up:
  - React
  - Building (converting react to HTML+JS)
  - Linting (syntax warnings, hints, and help)
  - A **development server**
    - With Live reload!
    - ONLY for development, not final use
- Vite isn't required for React, but is convenient
