# When do we build?

Do all your development with the development server
- Edit files in `src/`
- Uses `npm run dev` to run

If done and putting up web app for the public
- Then `npm run build`
- Use files inside `dist/` with your webserver
  - Such as `npx serve`, or Java, or C#, etc
  - Or our `server.js`! (more soon!)
