# `src/`

- Very similar to our webpack setup
- Almost all files we edit are here
- Our start point is `src/App.jsx`
- Technical start point is `src/main.jsx`
    - Not MixedCase because not a component
    - Loaded via `index.html`
    - It imports `src/App.jsx`
- If we import from `./`, it imports from `src/`
    - `import Test from './Test';`
