# Is React hard to learn?

- All depends on the mindset
- I've tried to create patterns
  - Event to State to Render
- If you are overwhelmed
  - Simplify what you are trying to understand
  - Not understanding is natural!
    - The process is called "learning"
      - Not automatic
      - Don't try to force it
