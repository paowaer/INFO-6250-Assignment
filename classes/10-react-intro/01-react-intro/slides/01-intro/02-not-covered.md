# There's a lot this course doesn't cover

- Better ways of HTML generation server-side
  - Including React! (SSR + SSG)
- Lots of details about webservers
- Other service types beyond REST
- So much a11y, i18n, HTML, CSS

Just too much to cover
- Goal is to get you to where you can grow
  - But you can do webdev NOW
- "Bad" code can still benefit the world
  - So benefit the world as you learn
