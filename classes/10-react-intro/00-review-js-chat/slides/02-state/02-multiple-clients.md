# Multiple Clients

We wrote FE and BE for this app
- But many services have _multiple_ clients!
- Service should be "kind" to clients
  - But clients can have different needs!
  - Don't tightly couple service and client
- We move to React for FE starting today
  - But services don't change!
    - Just a new client

** Service devs think in terms of _usable data_**
- Not specific app consumer
