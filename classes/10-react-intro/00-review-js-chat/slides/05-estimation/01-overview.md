# Estimation

- I got a LOT of requests for extension
- Some of you have had many extensions
  - Point is to prepare for working
  - Normal to occasionally be behind
  - Not good to always need more time
  - Not good to notice too late to matter
  - Workplaces often change non-deadline parts
    - You need time to make changes
